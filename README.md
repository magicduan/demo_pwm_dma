# Implement control WS2812 LED IC in STM32 G431RB Board
Refer to [the article interface Ws2812 with STM32](https://controllerstech.com/interface-ws2812-with-stm32/), implement WS2812 LED IC control in G431RB board.
The different is that I use "Byte" in memory data width instead of "Half Word" for saving memory.
